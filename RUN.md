Project Intrution into zone for x7 Edge AI box.

Unzip the project into the edge box by scp or copy.

All the configuration parameters can be found in run.sh file. By default some of them are already set.

ROI can be determined by the file zoning_tool.py file to extract the co-ordinates from a video or url.

Just need to execute the run.sh file to run the project.

Thanks.
